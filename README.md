#### ABSTRACT
The project aims to develop a Speech Recognition system that can transcribe
text from audio and video files. The system is also capable of analyzing the sentiment of the transcribed text. The project uses OpenAI Whisper and TextBlob
libraries to achieve this functionality. OpenAI Whisper is a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that is trained on a diverse range of
speech data. It is capable of transcribing audio files and performing language
detection and translation. TextBlob is a Python library that provides a simple
API for performing common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as
part-ofspeech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification,
translation, and more. The project uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the speech
from audio and video files. The transcribed text is then analyzed using TextBlob
to determine the sentiment of the text. The sentiment analysis is performed by
using the TextBlobâ€™s built-in sentiment analysis function, which returns a polarity score between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates negative sentiment, 0 indicates
neutral sentiment, and 1 indicates positive sentiment. The sentiment score is then
used to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
